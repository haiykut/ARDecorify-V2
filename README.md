# üöÄARDecorify V2

The purpose of this project is to enable interaction between designers/dealers and customers without any physical necessity by using augmented reality technologies.

## üèóÔ∏èArchitecture

The architecture of the project and this repository consists of folders named "Mobile" and "WebGL" made with Unity and "WebAPI" made with Java Spring Boot. Each folder is a source file for an application.

- In the [Mobile section](https://github.com/haiykut/ARDecorify-V2/tree/main/ARDecorify-Mobile), EasyAR SDK is utilized for plane detection and image target features, allowing customers to place furnitures in empty spaces such as rooms to get a preliminary idea. Also customers can send these decoration designs to designers/dealers then.

- In the [WebGL section](https://github.com/haiykut/ARDecorify-V2/tree/main/ARDecorify-WebGL), designers/dealers can view designs submitted by customers in a virtual room. The goal is to provide feedback to customers and enhance the decoration.

- In the [WebAPI section](https://github.com/haiykut/ARDecorify-V2/tree/main/ARDecorify-WebAPI), facilitates communication between customers and designers/dealers, laying the foundation for future features to be added, further advancing the project.

After you got your build, install .apk build file to an Android device that has gyroscope and accelerometer sensors.

- For the WebGL app, you must set the necessary url adjustments in the Unity editor and get the build. 
After you got your build files;
 Move Build, TemplateData folders and logo.png file to WebAPI/src/main/resources/static directory and move index.html to WebAPI/src/main/resources/templates directory.

- To run your WebAPI app, you can use [Java Spring Boot's instructions](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/).
